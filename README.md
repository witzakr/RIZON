-----------------------------------------------------
Challenges faced:
- text formatting (overall problems with the text placement and division)
- finding the adequate font (couldn't find website's original font)
- using less <div> 
- formatting images (problems with image placement and proper resizing)
- avoiding useless code in CSS
- setting up the flexbox
-----------------------------------------------------
Solutions: 
- putting text elements in a text container:

- using a font that I consider the best, straying a bit from the original design:

- using semantic elements instead of div:

- putting images in an image container:

- watching Flexbox tutorials and looking for sources explaining it (still in progress)
-----------------------------------------------------
Summary:
Overall I am satisfied with my performance, I made pretty decent progress. I did meet specific challenges, but I solved most of them. Lastly, I look forward to continuing to improve my skills and knowledge.

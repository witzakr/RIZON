Challenges faced:
- text formatting
- finding the adequate font
- using less <div>
- formatting images
- avoiding useless code in CSS
- setting up the flexbox
-----------------------------------------------------
Solutions: 
- putting text elements in a text container
- using a font that I consider the best, straying a bit from the original design
- limiting myself to only using <div> for image or text containers + semantic elements
- putting images in an image container
- Validating my code
- watching Flexbox tutorials and looking for sources explaining it
-----------------------------------------------------
Summary:
Overall I am satisfied with my performance, I can see that I made pretty decent progress. I did meet certain challenges, but I managed to solve most of them. Lastly, I look forward on continuing improving my skills and knowledge.
